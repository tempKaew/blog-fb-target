Recently, a FedEx courier headed out of his way to deliver an uncommon 27kg package to the Menzies family’s front door in Castle Pines, Colorado.

The Menzies were doing repair work on their home while out of city. When his contractor left for his lunch, the wind suddenly opened the door. Catcher, the household’s 3-year-old Golden Retriever, couldn’t resist the unusual opportunity to explore the world on her own. The dog ran out of the house and ventured precariously near to the main road. Fortunately, an alert FedEx deliveryman found Catcher before an accident happened.

Lisa Menzies, owner of Catcher, surmises that the delivery guy must have seen the dog roaming the neighborhood and delivered it to the address on its license plate.

Thankfully for us, the family buzzer camera captured the moment of heroism. The video clip shows the driver getting out of his truck with the fluffy package and delivering it safely to the Menzie house, closing the door behind him.

Lisa is grateful for the delivery boy’s act of heroism: “He interrupted her day and her package delivery schedule to choose her up, take her to our home, and shut the door behind him. I don’t wish to think about where else it could have finished, “he told to Fox Information.

Later, Lisa expressed her gratefulness on Twitter and called the delivery guy the “hero of the household.” Regardless of her efforts to reach him, she has yet to discover the identity of the vehicle driver.
