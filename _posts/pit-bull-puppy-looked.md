Pit Bull puppies, born into an unfair situation, were being sold as fighting dogs. The siblings that should have been going to loving homes were essentially facing a life filled with abuse, writes ilovemydogsomuch

Thankfully, a local rescue heard about their owner and intervened.

The rescue group, with help from the authorities, seized the entire litter and posted the story to their social media page.

A young woman, named Tawny, saw the puppies’ photos and fell head over heels in love with Keiko. She wanted to adopt Keiko along with his brother Niko but their town had a strict law: only three dogs were allowed per household. Tawny already had two other dogs. She reached out to the rescue and within a matter of days, Keiko was welcomed into his forever home.

Keiko was such a good puppy but Tawny couldn’t help feeling like something was missing. Still, she got Keiko settled in and he bonded beautifully with her other dogs. Sadly, though, their oldest pup who had lived a wonderful and long life, passed away. They were all devastated. But then, as if fate intervened, Tawny was scrolling through her phone and she saw a photo of Niko with an urgent message. The family who had adopted Niko did not treat him well. The rescue urged for them to bring Niko back and they did. He now needed a new home.

Tawny immediately reached out to the rescue. Now that they were a two-dog family, they knew Niko belonged with them. The rescue agreed. They picked Niko up the next day and brought him home. The poor pup had been through a lot. He was sweet but very timid.

The moment Keiko saw Niko for the first time, in their new home together, he immediately knew that this was his brother. He remembered him and that special connection was exactly what Niko needed. Keiko became his best friend and guardian, never leaving his side.

Niko’s first night in his new home was pretty scary. His new mom and dad put him in his new crate with his new blankets and tried to comfort him as much as possible. But Keiko knew better. He knew that Niko needed him in order to fall asleep. So Keiko snuck into his crate, cuddled up beside him, and they fell asleep together.

You have to see what happens next! Poor Niko was so traumatized and continued to fight through his emotions– but amazingly, his brother knew exactly what to do in order to change his life for the better. ALL THE FEELS!
