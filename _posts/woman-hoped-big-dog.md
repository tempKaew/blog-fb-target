Ever since she was a little girl, Diana Grib wanted to raise both a German Shepherd and a ferret. Despite her fascination with the 2 species, Diana knew she had to be careful and responsible before blindly adopting the vividly different creatures together, writes ilovemydogsomuch

Diana first adopted a German Shepherd puppy named Nova, and spent a year training her to be friendly with other creatures. As time passed, Nova blossomed into an exceedingly kind dog who would look out for tiny critters and care for them!

Finally, Diana went ahead and adopted a 2-year-old ferret named Pacco. She was nervous as she introduced the little ferret to Nova. The dog decided to be patient with Pacco and simply watched over him from afar for the first few days. Pacco was a timid boy, but he recognized a kindred spirit in Nova!

Within a few weeks, Pacco lost his inhibitions and became best buddies with Nova! The pair would eat together, play together, go shopping together and cuddle each other to sleep. Diana began taking the pair for outdoor adventures and it turned out to be the best part of their lives! Pacco loves to get right into Nova’s mouth and inspect her teeth from time to time!

Ferrets are known to be complex creatures who are affectionate but also very sensitive. Nova is always patient with Pacco and never hurts him even when the ferret wants to play rough. Diana says that despite their differences, both Nova and Pacco bond well because of their equally brave and curious personalities!

With her thoughtful planning, Diana has fulfilled her dream of raising these two wonderful creatures together and that’s really something! Nova and Pacco’s friendship is truly transcending!
