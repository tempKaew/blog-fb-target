The residents of the capital of Peru, Lima, were devastated after seeing a poor homeless dog carrying an empty bucket in hope to get some water in a very hot day.

We know that there was a recent drought in Peru, which caused many people to leave their houses in order to find water. Unfortunately, the drought took many lives. If the people suffered from that, just imagine how was the situation for the homeless animals!

Sadly, all the waterâ€™s open sources Lima are gone because of the lack of water. Heartbreakingly, this dog, who is about to be hopeless, decides to pick a bucket in hope to get the attention of people and to get some water.

You can see in the video below that the dog wants to collect as much water as he can as there was some water in the bucket. He is just thinking in future! The dog is also petted by one of the witnesses, who also tried to take the bucket off, but the dog just does not let the bucket go! You can see in the video below that the dog is struggling! How Poor!
