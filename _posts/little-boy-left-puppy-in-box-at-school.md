So, it takes a lot of maturity and selflessness for a kid to realize when he needs to let a puppy go and find her a safe home. That is what this kid did when he found a puppy but knew he couldn’t take care of her and needed to help find her a home.

So he did the most heartbreaking thing. He left the puppy in a box outside a school’s front door, knocked loudly on the door and ran away before anyone could question him. The janitor who was cleaning inside heard the knock and opened to door. He saw the boy running away, and looked down to discover the pup in the box.

But the pup wasn’t the only thing there. The little boy had left a heartbreaking note with the puppy. When the janitor read the note, he realized how much it must have hurt the boy to have to part with the dog, all for the dog’s own good.

“Sorry it didn’t have a home and it was cold so we were going to give it to you. Please do let it go find a nice home.”

Touched by the note, the janitor took the puppy to a dog-loving school teacher and the teacher immediately decided to foster the pup. The pup’s now named Snowflake. The teacher took Snowflake to a local rescue group, Detroit Pit Crew Dog Rescue, and had her checked up and vaccinated.

Detroit Pit Crew Dog Rescue soon helped find Snowflake a new home before Christmas! She now lives with her new family and has a big doggie sister to look up to, all thanks to the little boy who knew he had to do something to help this puppy!
