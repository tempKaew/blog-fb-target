If every animal has the right to live like other people, the world will start to change. They will have a better life with average growth and development.

Although we always wish for good things for animals, some wicked people left furry friends.

A puppy is abandoned at the bottom of a landfill, but it is only a bad situation in many worst cases that someone has hurt the animals.

They try to look for edible things in dumps to survive day by day.

The most accessible place to find food for homeless dogs is the landfill. A puppy is so tiny that he can be buried in a landfill and surrounded by giant sharp debris.

Fortunately, the dog was found by a group of volunteers. The volunteer team quickly saved the dog before things got worse.

After that, the dog was taken to a rescue center and treated carefully.

We realized that everything could happen from rescuing the dog. The veterinarian assessed that the dog’s health was relatively stable after examining the dog’s body. The dog is fortunate when there is no serious injury or illness.

The dog can drink clean water after a long struggle in the landfill to survive. He is supplemented with vitamins and vaccines to increase the resistance of the dog.

This adorable puppy has had a miraculous change of fate that he should have lived. The dog has received the care he needed at the shelter after being rescued from that dreadful dump. The dog deserves such great love.
