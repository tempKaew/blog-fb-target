Aaron was out driving one day when he saw a dog that had obviously been struck by another car. Without thinking twice, the veteran pulled over, ran across three lanes of traffic and came to the animal’s aid. It’s lucky he did; the dog had been hit by a car going at 110km and left for dead.

After taking the dog to the road side, where it was no longer at risk of being further injured by the traffic, Aaron called 911.

There, he waited for an astonishing three hours in the rain. When he realized he couldn’t wait any longer, Aaron made a stretcher for the pup and loaded him into the back of a friend’s truck.

“My combat lifesaver training kicked in and I’m thankful I was able to use it to help him,” Aaron explained. “Having served in Iraq, you see a lot of loss, which is one of the reasons I was determined to see him make it.”

Later scans showed that the pup, named Buster, had suffered broken ribs, a torn windpipe and internal bleeding. Fortunately, he would go on to make a full recovery, thanks in no small part to Aaron’s heroic actions.

Not only that, but Aaron went on to adopt Buster once his recovery was complete, meaning the dog will now enjoy the life of love and care he truly deserves.

Aaron is an inspiration and I’m sure Buster will have the perfect life in your care.
